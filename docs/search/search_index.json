In addition to several different model formats (e.g., .mat , .xml , .yml ), the repository contains a number of functions and data files to factilitate Human-GEM analysis, maintenance, editing, and other actions. We therefore recommend cloning the GitHub repository to gain full functionality and easy access to the most updated version of Human-GEM. Clone the repository (recommended) Clone the repository using git. Navigate to the directory where you would like to save the Human-GEM repository, and in the command line/terminal run: git clone https://github.com/SysBioChalmers/Human-GEM.git Alternative: Download as a .zip The latest release of the repository can be downloaded as a .zip file . Required software MATLAB (R2018 or newer) ( 30-day trial ) The RAVEN Toolbox (v2.3.1 or newer) Installation instructions Additional dependencies Solver To run flux balance analysis (FBA) or GEM extraction (using tINIT), a solver is required. A few options are listed below. Gurobi (recommended) Mosek GLPK The COBRA Toolbox The COBRA Toolbox is not required for most of the functions associated with Human-GEM. However, it offers many analysis tools that can be used with Human-GEM. Important The Human-GEM model files ( .mat , .xml , .yml ) are formatted for use with RAVEN. Before using the model with the COBRA toolbox, convert the model to a COBRA-friendly format in MATLAB using the ravenCobraWrapper function from the RAVEN Toolbox: cobraModel = ravenCobraWrapper(ravenModel);","title":"Installation"},{"location":"installation/#installation","text":"","title":"Installation"},{"location":"installation/#human-gem","text":"The Human-GEM model is maintained in a GitHub repository to facilitate tracking of changes and collaboration.
